This is an YouTube Video - Summarizer (Part 1). Here, 'Python' (v3.10.0 &amp; v3.11.5) has been used to create this project. Currently this project is under development for the possible future scopes.

Currently, this code:-
 • Reads the text in few blocks then gives it's respective output.
 • It generates reliable results.
 • It is available only in English.

Development in (Part 2):-
 • It will be even more accurate in terms of different types of English.
 • The output generated will be as a whole.
 • There will be the use 'Web Development' to display it as a finished product for public usage.
